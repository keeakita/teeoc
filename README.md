# Tee O.C.

An asset swapper for Tee K.O. that lets you play as your own characters.

## Current status

The only thing this does right now is (very thinly) wrap the flash decompiler and provide a way to replace image assets. The bulk of the work still remains to be done.

## License Disclaimer

I am providing code in this repository to you under an open source license. Because this is my personal repository, the license you receive to my code is from me and not from my employer (Facebook).

## Why GPL?

This program for the most part is a wrapper around [the JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://www.free-decompiler.com/flash/0), which is provided under the GPL. It's not really a library, I had to rip into the source code and copy portions of it to make this work since there's no real documentation. Since I'm directly taking GPL source, this project has to be GPL.
